## Important notes about next13

=> In the app folder we have a page folder which contains all the pages of the app, and routing is done automatically by nextjs
=>By default all the components are server side render, but we can change a component to client side render by using the 'use client'
=>In the public folder we have all the static files like images, fonts, etc and can be accessed by src="/image.png"
=>Navigation bar and footer will be used using nextJs layout.tsx file

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
